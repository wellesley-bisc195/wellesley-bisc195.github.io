# Instructions for Assignment01

## Introduction

In this assignment,
you will learn how to use github classroom
to download, complete, and test your assignments.
Make sure you have followed [the instructions](https://wellesley-bisc195.github.io/Assignments/assignment01.html)
to set up your account and join the classroom.

## Question 1

Did you complete the instructions for modifying
`some_variables.jl` and `some_functions.jl`?
You should have changed the variables `n` and `a`

and you should be able to execute `julia src/run.jl`
without errors.
Once you can, type `yes` between the quotations below

Note: this syntax (`question1 = "yes"`)
is called "variable assignment,"
and we'll learn more about this in the next lesson.

```julia:ex1
question1 = ""
```

of the working directory,
