The part that is complicated is that code tends to be:</p> <ol> <li><p>Literal - the computer can only do exactly what you specifically tell it; it won&#39;t try to guess your meaning and it doesn&#39;t understand nuance.</p> <li><p>Procedural - you must provide <strong>all</strong> of the commands and you must provide them <strong>in the correct order</strong></p> </ol> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;cDA3_5982h8">Watch this video</a> to get a sense of why this matters so much.</p> <p>In this course, we&#39;ll be primarily interacting with that computer code as plain text, but there are a bunch of tools that people have built to make that job a bit easier.</p> <h3>Installing your IDE</h3> <p>One of those tools is an &quot;Integrated Development Environment&quot; or &quot;IDE&quot;. This is basically just a text editor with a bunch of bells and whistles.</p> <p>There are a number of different text editors to chose from, but in this course, we&#39;re going to use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a></p> <ol> <li><p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download">Click here</a> and select the correct download for your operating system</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/vs-code-download.png" alt=vscode-download  /></p> <li><p>Open the downloaded file and follow the prompts to install the program</p> </ol> <div class=colbox-green ><div class=title >Tip</div> <p>If you prefer to use a different text editor, that&#39;s ok, but it&#39;s important to be sure it&#39;s a <em>plain text</em> editor and not a <em>rich text</em> editor like MS Word.

If you&#39;ve ever looked at files on your <code>Desktop</code>, or opened <code>Finder</code>/<code>Explorer</code> and navigated to your <code>Documents</code> folder, you&#39;ve been using the file system. Data is stored on your hard drive as a continuous binary sequence &#40;just <code>1</code>s and <code>0</code>s&#41; and without a filesystem, it would be impossible to find anything&#33;</p> <p><code>Finder</code>/<code>Explorer</code> are software programs used to interact with your filesystem. The filesystem contains a mix of files, which are blobs of information &#40;eg. a <code>.docx</code> file containing a MS Word doc&#41; and folders, which can contain files as well as other folders. Just to be confusing, what we colloquially call folders are technically called &quot;directories.&quot; I will use the terms interchangeably.</p> <p><img src="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/macintosh-terminal-pocket/9781449328962/httpatomoreillycomsourceoreillyimages1448104.png" alt="File system hierarchy" /></p> <p>You may not have thought much about how the filesystem is organized, but you probably have an intuitive sense of how this works. Your &quot;home&quot;<sup id="fnref:home"><a href="#fndef:home" class=fnref >[2]</a></sup> directory contains the <code>Desktop</code> and <code>Documents</code> directories, each of which might contain many other subdirectories and/or files, and each subdirectory may have yet more subdirectories and files and so on.</p> <p><code>Finder</code>/<code>Explorer</code> are examples of a graphical user interface &#40;GUI - pronounced &quot;gooey&quot;&#41;, that is a program that allows you to interact with it visually. However, GUIs are difficult to design and maintain, so most bioinformatics tools are built around &quot;command line&quot;<sup id="fnref:cl"><a href="#fndef:cl" class=fnref >[3]</a></sup> or text-based interfaces. The good news is that the organization of the filesystem is the same whether you&#39;re interacting with it in a GUI or in the terminal. And once you learn how to use the command line interface, you&#39;ll see that it is a powerful way to get a lot done quickly.</p> <h3 id=open_the_terminal_application ><a href="#open_the_terminal_application" class=header-anchor >Open the terminal application</a></h3> <p><strong>Mac Users</strong>: </p> <ol> <li><p>Open Applications</p> <li><p>Click Open the <code>Terminal</code> application</p> </ol> <p><strong>Windows Users</strong>: </p> <ol> <li><p>Click Start -&gt; Programs</p> <li><p>Open Windows Subsystem for Linux</p> </ol> <p>You will be greeted with a white or black box that contains some text, and a cursor next to the dollar symbol <code>&#36;</code>. This is the command prompt.</p> <div class=colbox-green ><div class=title >Tip</div> <p>Using the terminal can be quite challenging at first. For one, you cannot interact with text in the same way as you would in a word-processing program like Microsoft Word. In particular, you can&#39;t use your mouse to do things like click to move a cursor, or highlight a section of text to be deleted. Instead, you have to use <code>←</code> and <code>→</code> keys.</p></div> <h3 id=walk_around_your_file_system ><a href="#walk_around_your_file_system" class=header-anchor >Walk around your file system</a></h3> <p>Think of your filesystem as a branching network of roads that you can walk along. Each directory is a location that has a path back to its parent directory, may or may not contain objects &#40;files&#41;, and may have one or many roads leading to new locations &#40;subdirectories&#41;.</p> <p>Your present location, referred to as the &quot;working directory&quot;<sup id="fnref:wd"><a href="#fndef:wd" class=fnref >[4]</a></sup>, is your home folder when you first open the terminal. Let&#39;s see where that is.</p> <p>In your terminal, type <code>pwd</code> and press enter. This is the &quot;<code>p</code>rint <code>w</code>orking <code>d</code>irectory&quot;<sup id="fnref:print"><a href="#fndef:print" class=fnref >[5]</a></sup> command.</p> <pre><code class=language-sh >&#36; pwd
/home/kevin</code></pre> <p>If you&#39;re using a Mac, this probably displayed something like <code>/Users/yourname</code>.</p> <div class=colbox-green ><div class=title >Tip</div> <p>Whenever you see code blocks in these lessons that start with <code>&#36;</code>, this is a hint that it is a shell command. When copying or typing these commands, <strong>do not</strong> include the <code>&#36;</code> &#40;or anything to the left of it&#41;. For example, to complete the task above, you should only type <code>pwd</code>, then press enter.</p> <p><code>&#36;</code> is referred to as the &quot;prompt&quot; or &quot;command prompt&quot; &#40;if you&#39;re using a newer mac, on your terminal you may see <code>&#37;</code> instead&#41;. When you enter a command, you may or may not see some output &#40;which will not be preceded by <code>&#36;</code>&#41; and once the command has finished executing, you will see a new prompt.</p> <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> These code blocks will often be followed by a block that does <strong>not</strong> start with a <code>&#36;</code>. This is the expected output; you shouldn&#39;t try to copy-past this into your terminal.</p></div> <p>Let&#39;s take a look around. the <code>ls</code> command is used to <code>l</code>i<code>s</code>t the contents of the directory.</p> <pre><code class=language-sh >&#36; ls</code></pre>
<pre><code class=language-plaintext >bin      Documents     R       scratch
Desktop  Downloads     Public  repos</code></pre>
<p>Your output will likely look a bit different from mine, but you&#39;ll probably see <code>Documents</code> and <code>Desktop</code>, as well as other directories you may recognize.</p>
<div class=colbox-aqua ><div class=title >Windows Users</div>
<p>You may not see any output. This is because the default Ubuntu installation on Windows doesn&#39;t have any directories or files in the home folder. But we can actually trick the shell into using the Windows home folder instead. In the following command, replace <code>&lt;yourname&gt;</code> with your Windows username.</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >&#36; export HOME&#61;/mnt/c/Users/&lt;yourname&gt;
&#36; cd ~
&#36; pwd
/mnt/c/Users/&lt;yourname&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Now, enter <code>ls</code> again, and you should see the contents of your Windows home folder.</p></div>
<p>The <code>ls</code> command can also take a directory as an &quot;argument.&quot;<sup id="fnref:arg"><a href="#fndef:arg" class=fnref >[6]</a></sup> We&#39;ll talk more about what that means later - for now, just add <code>Desktop</code> to the command, separated by a space</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >&#36; ls Desktop
df.csv  dm.csv  dupes.csv  itp.svg</code></pre>
<p>Again, your output should look different from mine, but &#40;assuming you store anything on your Desktop&#41;, you should see a list of files and directories. If your <code>Desktop</code> is pristine, congratulations&#33; You won&#39;t see any output.</p>
<p>The filesystem is organized hierarchically - At the very top of the hierarchy is the <strong>root</strong><sup id="fnref:root"><a href="#fndef:root" class=fnref >[7]</a></sup>, which you can think of as a folder that contains all other files and folders. On a Mac &#40;and other Unix systems&#41;, the root is referred to with a single forward slash &#40;<code>/</code>&#41;, While on Windows machines, the root is probably <code>C:\</code>.</p>
<div class=colbox-aqua ><div class=title >Windows Users</div>
<p>When you open Windows Subsystem for Linux, you&#39;re actually running a fully functional operating system with its own file system. As a result, when you type <code>pwd</code> in the terminal, you will see something like <code>/home/yourname</code>, rather than seeing your Windows OS home folder.</p>
<p>But WSL has access to your files in a special path, <code>/mnt/c/</code>. If you want to see the files in your Windows <code>Desktop/</code> directory for example, look in <code>/mnt/c/Users/yourname/Desktop</code>.</p></div>
<h4 id=moving_around ><a href="#moving_around" class=header-anchor >Moving around</a></h4>
<p>Say you are sitting in your room, and you want to give someone directions to <a href="https://w100.wellesley.edu/lulu">Lulu</a>. One way to do this would be to give directions from where you are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Go out the door,</p>

<li><p>Go down the hall to the elevator</p>

<li><p>... etc</p>

</ol>
<p>In this case, you&#39;re providing a &quot;relative path&quot;<sup id="fnref:rp"><a href="#fndef:rp" class=fnref >[8]</a></sup> - the directions only make sense if the person is starting in your room. If they&#39;re at the Science Center and they follow your instructions, they will become hopelessly lost.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could provide directions from a shared point of reference.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Start at the campus gate on the corner of Weston Rd and Central St</p>

<li><p>Walk down the path and turn right just past the Child Study Center towards the Botanical Gardens</p>

<li><p>... etc</p>

</ol>
<p>In this case, you&#39;re providing an &quot;absolute path&quot;<sup id="fnref:ap"><a href="#fndef:ap" class=fnref >[9]</a></sup> - no matter where the person is at the time, the directions will make sense.</p>
<p>An absolute path is great, since the same instructions are always correct, regardless of where you are. But in many cases, it would be tedious to always have to start instructions from the same location - imagine if you had to explain the route to the nearest bathroom starting at the campus gate&#33;</p>
<p>When providing a file path to a unix operating system, you can also provide relative or absolute paths. There are two shared points of reference, your home folder and <code>root</code>, which are specified by <code>~/</code> and <code>/</code> respectively when placed at the beginning of the path.</p>
<p>Up above, when we looked at the contents of the Desktop using ls, we provided the <em>relative path</em> from where we were in the home folder. You can tell, because the path did not start with <code>~/</code> or <code>/</code>.</p>
<p>We could have done the same thing using an <em>absolute path</em>:</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >&#36; ls ~/Desktop
df.csv  dm.csv  dupes.csv  itp.svg</code></pre>
<p>The output here should be the same as what you got above. But what if we&#39;re in a different location?</p>
<h4 id=change_directory ><a href="#change_directory" class=header-anchor >Change directory</a></h4>
<p>In order to <code>c</code>hange the working <code>d</code>irectory, we use the <code>cd</code> command, giving a path as an argument. For example, to make <code>Desktop</code> the current working directory:</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >&#36; cd ~/Desktop</code></pre>
<div class=colbox-orange ><div class=title >Checking Question</div>
<p>Is <code>~/Desktop</code> a relative or absolute path?</p></div>
<p>It&#39;s a good idea &#40;in general, but especially while learning&#41; to repeatedly check that the thing you think happened actually happened.</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >&#36; pwd
/home/kevin/Desktop</code></pre>
<pre><code class=language-sh >&#36; ls
df.csv  dm.csv  dupes.csv  itp.svg</code></pre>
<p>Notice that with <code>ls</code>, we didn&#39;t have to give <code>Desktop</code> as an argument this time. By default, <code>ls</code> lists files in the current working directory.</p>
<div class=colbox-orange ><div class=title >Checking Questions</div>
<ol>
<li><p>What does <code>pwd</code> stand for?</p>

<li><p>What does <code>ls</code> stand for?</p>

<li><p>With <code>Desktop</code> as your working directory, how would you list the contents of your home folder?</p>

</ol></div>
<p>Let&#39;s go back to the home folder. Again, we can provide a relative or an absolute path - the absolute path back to home is always <code>~/</code>, but how do we do the relative path? To walk into subdirectories, we can just provide the name of the subdirectory, but how do we walk &quot;backwards&quot;, into a parent directory?</p>
<p>In unix, parent directories are indicated with <code>../</code>. So to go back home from <code>/home/kevin/Desktop</code> using a relative path, I would write:</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >&#36; cd ../
&#36; pwd
/home/kevin</code></pre>
<p>It is possible to be more specific about where you want to go after moving up a directory. For example, I could write <code>../Documents</code> to go up a directory and then move into my Documents folder.</p>
<p>You can also move up more than just one directory. For example, you can go up two directories with <code>../../</code></p>
<h4 id=practice ><a href="#practice" class=header-anchor >Practice</a></h4>
<p>Practice moving around your file system using <code>cd</code>, and checking where you are using <code>pwd</code> and <code>ls</code>. If you get lost, just enter <code>cd ~/</code> to get yourself home.</p>
<div class=colbox-green ><div class=title >Tip</div>
<p>Rather than typing long paths &#40;or even short ones&#41;,
use the <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code> key to do auto-completion.
For example, with your home folder as your current working directory,
type <code>ls De</code> &#40;don&#39;t execute&#41;, then press <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code>.
This should cause the terminal to fill in <code>ls Desktop</code> automatically.

Try typing <code>ls Do</code>, then <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code>.
The first time, nothing happens.
Why? Because both <code>Documents</code> and <code>Downloads</code> are valid completions,
and the terminal doesn&#39;t know which one you want.
If you hit <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code> again,
it will display all of the options available.
If you add a <code>c</code>, then hit <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code>, it should complete <code>Documents</code>.

As you&#39;re navigating around,
try to do as little typing as possible.
Get into the habit of typing a little bit of a path,
then hitting <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code> &#40;twice if nothing shows up the first time&#41;.</p></div>
<h3 id=manipulating_files_and_directories ><a href="#manipulating_files_and_directories" class=header-anchor >Manipulating files and directories</a></h3>
<p>Of course, looking around is not the only thing you can do from the terminal. Using the terminal allows you to rapidly view, edit, and otherwise manipulate stuff in your file system.</p>
<div class=colbox-red ><div class=title >Danger&#33;</div>
<p>It is possible to seriously and irreparably damage your computer using commands from the terminal.</p>
<p>Be sure to follow instructions carefully, and be sure to keep your backups current.</p></div>
<p>First, let&#39;s create a directory for use in this course. You can put it in your home directory, or in <code>Documents</code>, or if you have a directory where your course files usually go, that&#39;s fine too.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll assume you&#39;re making this in <code>~/Documents/</code>, but if you want it somewhere else, just modify the path accordingly. the command to <code>m</code>a<code>k</code>e a <code>dir</code>ectory is <code>mkdir &lt;path&gt;</code>.</p>
<div class=colbox-green ><div class=title >Tip</div>
<p>In many examples like this, I will refer to things wrapped in <code>&lt;&gt;</code>, like <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;username&gt;</code>. These are stand-ins for some other value. This is a signal that you should replace that text &#40;including the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> characters&#41; with the appropriate value.</p></div>
<h3 id=a_hrefid_directories-and-filescreate_and_explore_directories_and_files ><a href="#a_hrefid_directories-and-filescreate_and_explore_directories_and_files" class=header-anchor ><a href="@id directories-and-files">Create and explore directories and files</a></a></h3>
<pre><code class=language-sh >&#36; mkdir ~/Documents/bisc195
&#36; cd ~/Documents/bisc195
&#36; pwd
/home/kevin/Documents/bisc195</code></pre>
<p>Now, copy and execute the following command - don&#39;t worry about what it does. &#40;if you really want to know, you can read about it here: &quot;while loop&quot;<sup id="fnref:wl"><a href="#fndef:wl" class=fnref >[10]</a></sup>&#41;</p>
<div class=colbox-blue ><div class=title >Note</div>
<p>The following code boxes use <code>bisc195 &#36;</code> as the prompt - this is to remind you that you should be in the <code>bisc195</code> directory. But remember, the prompt <code>&#36;</code> and everything before it are <em>not</em> a part of the actual command</p></div>
<pre><code class=language-plaintext >bisc195 &#36; for i in &#123;1..10&#125;; do echo &quot;This is file #&#36;&#123;i&#125;&quot; &gt; &quot;file&#36;&#123;i&#125;.txt&quot;; done</code></pre>
<p>It should finish very quickly. Let&#39;s look at what it did</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >bisc195 &#36; ls
file1.txt  file2.txt  file4.txt  file6.txt  file8.txt
file10.txt file3.txt  file5.txt  file7.txt  file9.txt</code></pre>
<p>The code you executed created 10 files, each of which contains a bit of text. Look at the contents of <code>file1.txt</code> using the <code>head</code> command.</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >bisc195 &#36; head file1.txt
This is file #1</code></pre>
<p>The <code>head</code> command prints the first 10 lines of a file by default, but this file only has 1 line, so that&#39;s all that&#39;s shown.</p>
<div class=colbox-blue ><div class=title >Note</div>
<p>File names usually have 2 parts - the name and the &quot;extension.&quot; The extension, like <code>.txt</code> or <code>.docx</code>, usually tells you something about what the file contains, or how it&#39;s encoded, but this is not a requirement. The files above could have been named <code>fileX.whatever</code>, and still have the same content. Usually, it&#39;s a good idea to have the extension reflect what&#39;s in the file, <code>.txt</code> for text, <code>.jl</code> for julia code etc.</p></div>
<p>We can look at multiple files at the same time using the con<code>cat</code>enate command:</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >bisc195 &#36; cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
This is file #1
This is file #2
This is file #3</code></pre>
<p><code>cat</code> takes any number of files &#40;even just 1&#33;&#41; and prints their entire content to the screen one after another. Be careful - some files are really long, and will go on and on and on and on and...</p>
<h3 id=glob_patterns ><a href="#glob_patterns" class=header-anchor >Glob patterns</a></h3>
<p>If we want to print the content of all 9 files, we could type them all out, but that would get tedious. There are many useful shortcuts in programming &#40;programmers

 like efficiency&#41;, one of which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_&#37;28programming&#37;29">glob patterns</a>.</p>
<p>The most common <code>glob</code> is <code>*</code>, which stands for any number of characters, including none.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >bisc195 &#36; cat *.txt
This is file #1
This is file #10
This is file #2
This is file #3
This is file #4
This is file #5
This is file #6
This is file #7
This is file #8
This is file #9</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>*.txt</code> means &quot;anything that ends with <code>.txt</code>&quot;.</p>
<p>Another <code>glob</code> is <code>?</code>, which matches any single character.</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >bisc195 &#36; cat file?.txt
This is file #1
This is file #2
This is file #3
This is file #4
This is file #5
This is file #6
This is file #7
This is file #8
This is file #9</code></pre>
<p>Notice that in this example, <code>file10.txt</code> is not included, since there are 2 characters between <code>file</code> and <code>.txt</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, you can use brackets to specify specific characters, or ranges of characters:</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >bisc195 &#36; cat file&#91;2468&#93;.txt
This is file #2
This is file #4
This is file #6
This is file #8</code></pre>
<pre><code class=language-sh >bisc195 &#36; cat file&#91;6-8&#93;.txt
This is file #6
This is file #7
This is file #8</code></pre>
<p>Let&#39;s make a new file that contains the content of all of the others. The <code>&gt;</code> character at the end of a command redirects the output of that command into a new file, so we can do:</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >bisc195 &#36; cat file*.txt &gt; all_files.txt
bisc195 &#36; ls
all_files.txt file10.txt    file3.txt     file5.txt     file7.txt     file9.txt
file1.txt     file2.txt     file4.txt     file6.txt     file8.txt</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the <code>cat</code> command in this case didn&#39;t print anything to the screen.</p>
<p>We can check that the right content went into <code>all_files.txt</code> using <code>cat</code> again.</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >bisc195 &#36; cat all_files.txt
This is file #1
This is file #10
This is file #2
This is file #3
This is file #4
This is file #5
This is file #6
This is file #7
This is file #8
This is file #9</code></pre>
<h3 id=move_and_copy_files ><a href="#move_and_copy_files" class=header-anchor ><code>m</code>o<code>v</code>e and <code>c</code>o<code>p</code>y files</a></h3>
<p>We&#39;ll use this directory for the rest of this course, but it could use some more organization. First, let&#39;s make a directory called <code>lesson1</code>.</p>
<p>Can you remember how to make a new directory? I&#39;m not going to provide the command for this step, but before moving on, you should be able to execute the following command without getting an error:</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >bisc195 &#36; ls lesson1/
bisc195 &#36;</code></pre>
<p>When you first create the directory, it will be empty, so <code>ls</code> won&#39;t return anything.</p>
<p>If you see <code>ls: lesson1: No such file or directory</code>, don&#39;t move on to the next step.</p>
<div class=colbox-red ><div class=title >Danger&#33;</div>
<p>Neither the <code>mv</code> nor <code>cp</code> command ask before overwriting files, and there&#39;s no &quot;undo&quot; at the command line. In other words, if you move or copy a file into a directory with file of the same name, the later file will be destroyed and will not be recoverable.</p>
<p>Use caution when using these commands outside the context of these lessons.</p></div>
<p>Once you&#39;ve created the <code>lesson1/</code> directory, let&#39;s <code>m</code>o<code>v</code>e the text files we&#39;ve created into it. The <code>mv</code> command take the form <code>mv &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt;</code>. For example:</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >bisc195 &#36; mv file1.txt lesson1/file1.txt
bisc195 &#36;</code></pre>
<p>Now,</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >bisc195 &#36; ls lesson1
file1.txt</code></pre>
<pre><code class=language-sh >bisc195 &#36; ls
all_files.txt file2.txt     file4.txt     file6.txt     file8.txt     lesson1
file10.txt    file3.txt     file5.txt     file7.txt     file9.txt</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, <code>file1.txt</code> has been moved to the <code>lesson1/</code> subdirectory, and is no longer in the current directory.</p>
<p>If we don&#39;t want to change the name of the file, we can actually just provide a directory as the destination, rather than typing out the entire new path.</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >bisc195 &#36; mv file2.txt lesson1/
bisc195 &#36; ls lesson1
file1.txt file2.txt</code></pre>
<p>In this way, we can move multiple files at the same time, separated by spaces, as long as the final argument is a directory:</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >bisc195 &#36; mv file3.txt file4.txt file5.txt lesson1/
bisc195 &#36; ls lesson1/
file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt file5.txt</code></pre>
<p>Remember, <code>ls</code> without an argument shows us the contents of the current directory.</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >bisc195 &#36; ls
all_files.txt file10.txt    file6.txt     file7.txt     file8.txt     file9.txt     lesson1</code></pre>
<div class=colbox-purple ><div class=title >Practice</div>
<p>Can you figure out how to move the rest of the <code>file*.txt</code> files to the <code>lesson1/</code> directory using a glob pattern?</p></div>
<p>Once you&#39;ve moved all the text files <em>other than</em> <code>all_files.txt</code> into the <code>lesson1</code> folder, change the working directory to <code>lesson1</code> using <code>cd</code></p>
<div class=colbox-green ><div class=title >Tip</div>
<p>If you accidentally moved <code>all_files.txt</code> into <code>lesson1/</code>, you can move it back using the relative path <code>./</code>, which means &quot;current directory.&quot; In other words, from the <code>bisc195</code> directory, you can execute <code>mv lesson1/all_files.txt ./</code>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you&#39;ve already done <code>cd lesson1</code>, you can do <code>mv all_files.txt ../</code>. Recall that <code>../</code> means &quot;parent directory.&quot;</p></div>
<p>The <code>c</code>o<code>p</code>y command works the same way as <code>mv</code>, except that the original stays where it is.</p>
<p>Check to make sure you&#39;re in the <code>lesson1</code> directory:</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >lesson1 &#36; pwd
/home/kevin/Documents/bisc195/lesson1</code></pre>
<pre><code class=language-sh >lesson1 &#36; ls ./
file1.txt  file2.txt  file4.txt  file6.txt  file8.txt
file10.txt file3.txt  file5.txt  file7.txt  file9.txt</code></pre>
<pre><code class=language-sh >lesson1 &#36; ls ../
all_files.txt lesson1</code></pre>
<p>Let&#39;s copy <code>all_files.txt</code> into the current directory using <code>cp</code>:</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >lesson1 &#36; cp ../all_files.txt ./
lesson1 &#36; ls
all_files.txt file10.txt    file3.txt     file5.txt     file7.txt     file9.txt
file1.txt     file2.txt     file4.txt     file6.txt     file8.txt</code></pre>
<pre><code class=language-sh >&#36; ls ../
all_files.txt lesson1</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, <code>all_files.txt</code> is now present in both the parent <code>bisc195/</code> directory <em>and</em> the <code>lesson1/</code> directory.</p>
<div class=colbox-purple ><div class=title >Practice</div>
<p>Make a copy of <code>file1.txt</code> called <code>file1_second.txt</code> in the <code>lesson1/</code> directory. To check that you&#39;ve succeeded, execute <code>ls file1*.txt</code>, and the output should be <code>file1.txt file10.txt file1_second.txt</code></p></div>
<h3 id=rename_and_remove_files ><a href="#rename_and_remove_files" class=header-anchor >Rename and <code>r</code>e<code>m</code>ove files</a></h3>
<div class=colbox-red ><div class=title >Danger&#33;</div>
<p>Once again, there is NO undo when using the terminal. I once deleted 10 Gb of sequencing files from a lab server in 2 seconds with a 13 character command.</p>
<p>Please use care with these commands.</p></div>
<p>We actually don&#39;t need 2 copies of the <code>all_files.txt</code>. Let&#39;s <code>r</code>e<code>m</code>ove the one in the <code>bisc195</code> directory.</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >lesson1 &#36; rm ../all_files.txt
lesson1 &#36; ls ../
lesson1</code></pre>
<p>Come to think of it - we don&#39;t need any of these files. Let&#39;s remove them all.</p>
<div class=colbox-red ><div class=title >Danger&#33;</div>
<p>I know, I&#39;m repeating myself. <code>rm</code> combined with glob patterns can do a lot of damage very quickly. Beware&#33;</p></div>
<p>Before we do anything, verify we&#39;re still in the <code>lesson1</code> directory using <code>pwd</code> and <code>ls</code>.</p>
<p>Then, remove all of the <code>.txt</code> files in the current directory:</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >lesson1 &#36; rm *.txt
lesson1 &#36; ls
lesson1 &#36;</code></pre>
<p>We don&#39;t need the <code>lesson1</code> directory either. First, move to the parent directory &#40;<code>bisc195/</code>&#41; using <code>cd</code>. <code>rm</code> doesn&#39;t work on directories:</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >bisc195 &#36; rm lesson1
rm: lesson1: is a directory</code></pre>
<p>Instead, use the <code>r</code>e<code>m</code>ove <code>dir</code>ectory command:</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >bisc195 &#36; rmdir lesson1
bisc195 &#36; ls
bisc195 &#36;</code></pre>

<p>Here&#39;s some more information about the loop you <a href="@ref directories-and-files">ran earlier</a>, but at least for now, it&#39;s not necessary to understand it. The code</p>
<pre><code class=language-sh >for counter in &#123;1..10&#125;; do echo &quot;This is file #&#36;&#123;counter&#125;&quot; &gt; &quot;file&#36;&#123;counter&#125;.txt&quot;; done</code></pre>
<p>is an example of a &quot;for loop&quot;, which we&#39;ll learn more about later. For loops execute code the same code multiple times, usually with something changing each time through. Here, the code <code>for counter in &#123;1..10&#125;</code> means &quot;run this loop for each of the values from 1-10&quot;, and also provides a <code>counter</code> variable with that value.</p>
<p>Inside the loop is a single command: <code>&quot;This is file #&#36;&#123;counter&#125;&quot; &gt; &quot;file&#36;&#123;counter&#125;.txt&quot;&quot;</code> means &quot;write the text &#39;this is file #1&#39; in a file called <code>file1.txt</code>&quot; when the value of <code>counter</code> is 1, &quot;write the text &#39;this is file #2&#39; in a file called <code>file2.txt</code>&quot; when the value of <code>counter</code> is 2, etc.</p>
<p>So, in the first cycle of the loop, <code>file1.txt</code> is created. We then go to the top of the loop, reset the counter, then we go again - <code>file2.txt</code> is created, the value of <code>counter</code> is set to 3, and so on.</p>
<p>When <code>file10.txt</code> is created, the  loop is finished &#40;<code>done</code>&#41;. All of this should take less than a second to execute.</p>
