Choose 2 additional sequence features to analyze. You might use your <code>AlignmentAlgorithms</code> code to create and alternate distance metric, or compare and plot kmer compositions from different geographical regions, or accross time.</p> <p>Each analysis should comprise</p> <ol> <li><p>Implementation and application of functions written in julia to generate metrics.</p> <li><p>Tables and / or plots that summarize the findings.</p> <li><p>Descriptions of the code, how it&#39;s used, and the results obtained.</p> </ol> <p>For your analysis plan, create a file called <code>analysis_plan.md</code> in the root of your analysis repository, and write ~300-600 words describing what you plan to do. Use markdown syntax, including headers and bulleted or numbered lists. You should explain</p> <ol> <li><p>What analysis you plan to do</p> <li><p>What functions you will use, including any new functions that you need to write</p> <li><p>How you intend to display the results &#40;eg what will you plot, or how will you summarize the results&#41;</p> </ol> <p>It&#39;s OK if you&#39;re not 100&#37; sure how to implement every part of your analysis, I can help&#33; But your intentions, and a plan of action should be clear.</p> <p>Your analysis plan is considered submitted when you have pushed the file to github, and opened an issue tagging Kevin and noting the specific commit.</p> <h4 id=excellent_-_full_credit_5_pts ><a href="#excellent_-_full_credit_5_pts" class=header-anchor >Excellent - full credit &#40;5 pts&#41;</a></h4> <ul> <li><p>Two proposed analyses are clear and concise, and contain details including descriptions of functions needed, plots or other display items intended, and a clear roadmap for how to generate them</p> <li><p>Markdown formatting is used effectively to organize into subsections, emphasize important points, and provide concise descriptions in lists</p> <li><p>Assignment is submitted on time</p> </ul> <h4 id=good_-_partial_credit_4_pts ><a href="#good_-_partial_credit_4_pts" class=header-anchor >Good - partial credit &#40;4 pts&#41;</a></h4> <ul> <li><p>Two proposed analyses are clear and concise, but are missing some details of functions needed, plots or other display items intended</p> <li><p>Roadmap for generating intended analyses is clear, but missing some steps, or is complete but not entirely clear.</p> <li><p>Markdown formatting is used, but not as effectively as possible</p> <li><p>Assignment is submitted on time</p> </ul> <h4 id=needs_work_-_partial_credit_3_or_fewer_points ><a href="#needs_work_-_partial_credit_3_or_fewer_points" class=header-anchor >Needs work - partial credit &#40;3 or fewer points&#41;</a></h4> <ul> <li><p>Only 1 analysis proposed, or descriptions of analyses are incomplete</p> <li><p>Descriptions of functions needed and plots or other display items are unclear or incomplete</p> <li><p>Markdown formatting is used sparingly or not at all.</p> <li><p>Assignment is submitted late, or incorrectly.</p> </ul> <h3 id=code_repository_15_points ><a href="#code_repository_15_points" class=header-anchor >Code Repository &#40;15 points&#41;</a></h3> <p>Using the same repository that you began with <a href="assignments/Assignment07">Assignment07</a>, you will create a julia package containing the functions required for implementing your analysis plan.</p> <p>Functions that you intend to use in the analysis should be exported, documented in docstrings, and tested in <code>test/runtests.jl</code>. Throughout this course, we&#39;ve been practicing how to write code, read and write documentation, and tests. This is the chance to show off what you&#39;ve learned&#33;</p> <p>Functions should be well-written, using type signatures where appropriate &#40;eg if using different methods for <code>String</code>s and <code>Char</code>s&#41;. Function, conditional, and loop blocks should be properly inedented. If the purpose of some code might be unclear, use comments to describe what it does.</p> <p>Docstrings should contain a signature describing what arguments are used, eg</p> <pre><code class=language-julia >&quot;&quot;&quot;
    my_func&#40;foo, bar; some_kwarg&#41;

Here&#39;s the description...
&quot;&quot;&quot;
function my_func&#40;foo, bar; some_kwarg&#61;3&#41;
    # ...
end</code></pre> <p>Docstrings should provide clear explanations of the intent of the function, as well as examples of proper inputs and expected outputs.</p> <p>The automated tests for your project should include tests for all exported functions, for as many possible inputs as possible. When you have conditionals in a function, all branches of the conditional should be tested separately. One goal of automated tests is to make sure that if changes are made later, any breakage will be caught.</p> <p>Preliminary scores will be given based on first draft if completed on time, but final scores will only consider the final submission. Submission is complete when a <code>v0.1.x</code> release is tagged and Kevin is notified.</p> <h4 id=excellent_-_full_credit_15_points ><a href="#excellent_-_full_credit_15_points" class=header-anchor >Excellent - Full credit &#40;15 points&#41;</a></h4> <ul> <li><p>All functions needed for analysis are exported, documented, and tested.</p> <li><p>Function code is clean and clear, with proper indentation used throughout.

Merely descriptive comments are not sufficient. Eg, you can write</p> <blockquote> <p>I wanted to look at the GC content, since this is an easy-to-calculate though crude measure of how related two sequences are related.</p> </blockquote> <pre><code class=language-julia-repl >julia&gt; gc_content&#40;seq1&#41;
0.3

julia&gt; gc_content&#40;seq2&#41;
0.32</code></pre> <blockquote> <p>As you can see, these two sequences are pretty close.</p> </blockquote> <p>Not just,</p> <blockquote> <p>Next, I calculated the GC content</p> </blockquote> <pre><code class=language-julia-repl >julia&gt; gc_content&#40;seq1&#41;
0.3

julia&gt; gc_content&#40;seq2&#41;
0.32</code></pre> <p>You may include things that you tried that didn&#39;t work alongside the completed analysis.</p> <p>Preliminary scores will be given based on first draft if completed on time, but final scores will only consider the final submission.
